Python Libraries
numpy: Fundamental package for numerical computing with Python.
matplotlib: Plotting library for Python, used for visualizing data.
pandas: Data manipulation and analysis library.
pygame: Library for writing video games or other multimedia applications.
pybullet: Physics engine for simulating robotics and various mechanics in 3D.
Additional Tools and Resources
Anaconda: Python distribution platform that includes commonly used libraries and tools for scientific computing.
Visual Studio Code (VS Code): Integrated development environment (IDE) for writing and debugging code.
PyBullet Data: Additional data files required by PyBullet for simulations.
File Structure and Organization
URDF Files: These are XML files that describe the physical properties of objects in PyBullet simulations. You'll need these for specific objects like the racecar used in your simulation.
Project Setup and Management
Project Folder: Ensure your project is organized into separate files or modules (car_sim.py, trajectory_data.py, 3D_sim.py, and final_sim.py as you've structured).
Version Control: Optionally, consider using Git for version control to manage changes and collaborate effectively.
Documentation and Learning Resources
Python Documentation: Official documentation for Python and each library (numpy, matplotlib, pandas, pygame, pybullet).
Tutorials and Examples: Online resources and tutorials for learning Python, PyBullet, and simulation concepts.
Notes
Installation: Use pip to install the libraries listed in requirements.txt using the command pip install -r requirements.txt.
Environment: Activate your Anaconda environment (conda activate car_sim) before installing dependencies.
Updates: Periodically update libraries to their latest versions for bug fixes and new features (pip install --upgrade package_name).
